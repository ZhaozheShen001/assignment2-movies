# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
About 1 day.  
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. 
See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I am most satisfied with the design and compilation of class functions.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
What I am most dissatisfied with is that in sortfunction, only conditional statements can be used to judge the key, and no better method has been found.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
So far, everything is working fine.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I should design the specific functions of the class first and then write the code.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I learned the usage of key in sort function and kivy on google.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
I am not very familiar with the syntax of python, so I spent a lot of time practicing basic syntax and the use of python classes.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
When using python classes, consider class functions as objects, so that you can understand the mechanism of class functions well.
